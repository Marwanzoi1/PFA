Great choice, Marouane! You're going to build a powerful and modern project:

> 🔐 **Project Title (draft):** > **“Multi-Agent Intelligent System for Real-Time Cyber Threat Detection and Response”**

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Build

A smart **AI-powered cybersecurity agent** that monitors logs or network activity, detects suspicious behavior (e.g., port scans, brute force, strange packets), and **automatically reacts** (e.g., send alert, block IP).

You’ll use **Python + AI + basic cybersecurity tools**, and structure your work in **weekly sprints** as required.

## 🛠️ Tools You Can Use

| Tool                      | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Python                    | Main programming language        |
| Scapy / tshark / Zeek     | For capturing/analyzing traffic  |
| TensorFlow / scikit-learn | For anomaly detection models     |
| Flask / FastAPI           | To expose agent as a service     |
| Docker                    | Optional — to containerize agent |
| VSCode / GitHub           | Code + version control           |

## 📅 Sprint Plan (4 Weeks)

Here's a week-by-week plan to match the Agile sprint method required:

---

### ✅ **Week 1: Research & Planning Sprint**

**Goal:** Understand and design your agent system

#### Tasks:

- Study papers on IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)
- Analyze existing tools (Zeek, Snort, Wazuh, etc.)
- Understand what features to extract (e.g., packet rate, port frequency)
- Decide: **Log-based** or **Network-based detection?**
- Sketch architecture:

  - Agent listener
  - Analyzer (ML)
  - Response engine

🔍 **arXiv search keywords:**

- “AI for intrusion detection”
- “anomaly detection network traffic”
- “multi-agent threat systems”

---

### ✅ **Week 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing**

**Goal:** Gather data to train/test the detection system

#### Tasks:

- Use datasets like:

  - [CICIDS 2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
  - [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)

- Or simulate attacks with **Kali Linux** tools (nmap, Hydra…)
- Extract features (e.g., IPs, protocols, port usage, packet size, timestamps)
- Preprocess: normalize, clean, label data

---

### ✅ **Week 3: AI Agent Model & Detection Logic**

**Goal:** Build the intelligent detection agent

#### Tasks:

- Train a lightweight model:

  - Isolation Forest (for anomalies)
  - SVM or Random Forest

- Implement agent behavior:

  - If threat detected → log & alert
  - Optionally: auto-block via IP tables

- Build a FastAPI or Flask interface for the agent

---

### ✅ **Week 4: Test, Benchmark, Improve**

**Goal:** Test agent performance & add features

#### Tasks:

- Run tests: simulate real-time attacks
- Measure:

  - False positives/negatives
  - Detection time

- Improve logic (adjust thresholds, features)
- Add log dashboard or Telegram alert

---

## 🔬 Research Goals (parallel to dev)

1. **Scientific Articles (arXiv):**

   - Find 3–5 relevant papers
   - Summarize their detection methods
   - Compare with your approach

2. **Theses:**

   - Look for doctoral research on IDS/AI agents
   - Check [theses.fr](https://theses.fr), [core.ac.uk](https://core.ac.uk)

3. **Application Benchmark:**

   - Compare tools like Snort, Zeek, Suricata
   - List their detection rules, strengths, limitations

---

## 📈 Final Deliverable (MVP)

- One agent that can:

  - Monitor traffic or logs
  - Analyze using AI logic
  - Take a basic action (alert/log/block)

- Research file (PDF or slides)

  - Summary of articles, theses, tools

- Optionally: dashboard for alerts or logs

---

## 🚀 Want Help With Next Steps?

Just say:

- **“Give me a final problem statement”**
- **“Suggest papers from arXiv”**
- **“Help me with the dataset or code to start”**

And I’ll build it out for you.

Do you want the **problem statement** and **GitHub repo structure** next?
